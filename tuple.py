#tuple in python - a built in data type that lets us create immutable sequence of values.

# tup = (1) #its type is integer
# tup = (1,) #its type is tuple

tup = (2,1,3,2,5)
# print(tup[0])

# tuple methods

# tup.index(element) #return index of first occurrence
# tup.count(element) #return total occurrences

# print(tup.index(3))
print(tup.count(2))
