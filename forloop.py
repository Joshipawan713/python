# for loops in python
# loops are used for sequential traversal. for traversing list, string, tuples etc.
# for loops
# syntax - for element in list:
            # print(element)
            
# syntax for loops with else
# for element in list:
    # print(element)
# else:
    #print(element)
    
# in list for loop 

# list = [1,2,3,4,5]
# list = ["onion","brijal","ladyfinger","potato"]

# for val in list:
#     print(val)


# tup = (1,2,3,4,5,6)
# string = "hellopython"

# for num in string:
#     print(num)
# else:
#     print("End")

# # range function in for loop - range functions returns a sequence of numbers starting from 0 by default, and increment by 1 by default , and stops before a specified number.
# # syntax - range(start?,stop?,step?)

# # seq = range(5)
# for i in range(10): #frange(stop)
#     print(i)
    
# for i in range(2,10): #range(start,stop)
#     print(i)
    
# for i in range(2,10,2): #range(start,stop)
#     print(i)

# pass statement - pass is null statement that does nothing it is used as a placeholder for future code.
# syntax -
# for element in range(5):
#     pass

for i in range(5):
    #empty
    pass
print("end of loop")
